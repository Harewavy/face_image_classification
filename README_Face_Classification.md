# Face Image Classification

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify human face images using computer vision techniques. The main goal is to determine whether facial features extracted from images can be used to solve practical business problems.

## Project Description

In this project, we explore the power of computer vision to analyze images of faces. The tasks include:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of face image data.
- Training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify faces.
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix.
- Assessing the practical value of applying image classification in real-world scenarios.

## Dataset

Due to file size limitations, the dataset is not included directly in this repository. You can download it from the following link:
