# Facial Image Age Classification

This project focuses on building a computer vision model to classify the approximate age group of individuals from facial images. The objective is to analyze customer images and provide insights that can help in personalized marketing, age-based targeting, or user engagement strategies.

## Project Objectives

- Load and explore a dataset of facial images.
- Build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for age classification.
- Evaluate the model's performance and discuss potential applications.

## Dataset

The dataset contains labeled facial images in JPEG format. The accompanying `labels.csv` file provides the ground truth age group for each image.

Directory structure:
```
faces/
├── faces/
│   ├── final_files/        # Contains image files
│   ├── labels.csv          # Contains image file names and age group labels
```

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Pandas & NumPy for data handling

## Model Summary

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained using the face image dataset. The model achieved [Insert Accuracy]% accuracy on the validation set. The model was evaluated using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Potential Applications

- **Personalized Marketing**: Use age group predictions to tailor content or advertisements to specific demographics.
- **Age Verification Systems**: Assist in verifying user-provided age in online platforms.
- **Retail and In-Store Analytics**: Provide age-based analysis for physical stores via in-store cameras.

## Conclusion

Computer vision proves to be a viable solution for estimating demographic data such as age group from images. The model trained here provides a good starting point for practical implementations in customer analytics.

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate more diverse and larger datasets to improve generalization.
- Fine-tune CNN architecture and introduce transfer learning for better performance.
- Use face landmarks or embeddings to boost classification accuracy.
